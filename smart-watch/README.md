# Smart Watch
The current version 3 is a smart watch with no touch support. 
It uses ESP 32 S3 for functioning. Also heart rate and spo2 sensors. 
I believe the best use case for that would be to useit as a data receiver and sender where no touch is required. Eg. Hospitals

Version4 
Will include a touch module but will be still restricted with the memory size of Adafruit Feather -SENSE NRF5284 or ESP S3 DK
Will be updated shortly
